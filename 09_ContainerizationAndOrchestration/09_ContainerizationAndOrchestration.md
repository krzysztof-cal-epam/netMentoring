# Questions for the self-check:

## 1. What is orchestration?
Term orchestration refers to the automated management, coordination and deployment of multiple containers or services to ensure they work together. This includes scaling, load balancing, service discovery, resource allocation, disaster recovery and fault tolerance. 

## 2. What is containerization and the pros and cons of using it?
Contenerization is a type of virtualization that allows applications and their dependencies to be deployed into portable units called containers. Those containers run in an isolated environments.
Pros od contenerization:
1. Portability - containers run accross different environment like OS (Windows, Linux, Mac),
2. Efficency - containers uses fewer resources than Virtual Machines,
3. Scalability - containers can be scaler up to handle increased workload,
4. Isolation - containers run in tehir own environment, therefore do not affecting other applications.

Cons of contenerization:
1. Security - containers share the host core, therefore compromised container could potentially affect the host and other containers,
2. Complexity - managing large numbers of containers requires orchestration tools like Kubernetes, which can be difficult to manage,
3. Limited isolation - containers are less isolated than Virtual Machines.
